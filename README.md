# Dev Container Features

Dev container features are self-contained, reusable units of installation code
and dev container configuration that you can add to your dev container feature.
You can think of it as reusable pieces of Dockerfile instructions.

For more information, check [the official documentation](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/).

This repository contains the following dev container features:

- [zsh-plugins](src/oh-my-posh)
- [oh-my-posh](src/oh-my-posh)

More information about each feature is available in the respective README.
