# Dev Container Features

Dev Container Features are self-contained, reusable units of installation code
and dev container configuration that you can add to your dev container. You can
think of them as reusable pieces of Dockerfile instructions. For more
information, check [the official
documentation](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/).

- [oh-my-posh](src/oh-my-posh)
- [tree-sitter-cli](src/tree-sitter-cli)
- [python-venv](src/python-venv)
